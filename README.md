How to use:

To test locally, create a copy of the project in a different directory and run two instances of the terminal running one from the original project and one from the copy in the different directory. This is to properly simulate two different devices.

Each instance will ask for a local user name. While new users can be created, it will be easier to use the pre-exsting ones: grayson or aubrey.

typing ?help will give a list of available commands, some are nonfunctional but do not interfere with the promissed functionality.

type ?connect to begin a connection. It will ask for the name of a remote host.
Type in "grayson" if the local user is "aubrey" and vice versa.

Once it indicats a connection is made, you may type whatever and it will be sent to the other terminal along with info about the encryption and hashing used.

typing ?stop will disband the connection and end the program in the terminal it was typed on.
